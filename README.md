Predictive Analysis on Diabetes, Liver and Kidney Diseases Using Machine Learning.
Healthcare data analysis is becoming one of the most promising research areas. Diabetes, Liver Disease and Chronic Kidney Disease combinedly affects a mass of worldâ€™s population.

The objective of this project is to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the used Machine Learning models for the prediction of these three diseases. It focuses on structured data and for the best possible output classification and prediction, advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes Classification, XGBoost Classifier, Kernel Support Vector Classification and Logistic Regression has been used.
